Domain Background
Many individuals struggle to obtain home loans due to poor or nonexistent credit histories, often turning to high-interest lenders. 
Banks also face difficulties identifying reliable borrowers since traditional credit scores don’t provide the full picture. 
Machine learning models, analyzing a broader range of factors, can more accurately assess loan default risk, benefiting both borrowers and lenders by improving loan access and reducing default risk.


Problem Statement

This study aims to build an end-to-end loan scoring system for a bank, combining application data and bureau information. 
The goal is to help Home Credit decide which loan applications to approve or reject based on applicants' past behavior and application details.
